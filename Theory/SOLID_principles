SOLID PRINCIPLES OF OOPS

S - Single Responsibility Principle
O - Open/Close principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segmented Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle

BENIFITS
- Avoid duplicate code
- Easy to maintain
- Easy to understand
- Flexible software
- Reduce complexity

- SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE (A class should have only 1 reason to change)
  - Easy to maintain
  - Easy to understand
- OPEN/CLOSE PRINCIPLE (Open for extension but closed for modification)
- LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE (If class B is subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program, subclass should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down)
- INTERFACE SEGMENTED PRINCIPLE (Interface should be such, that client should not implement functions they don't need)
- DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE (Class should depend on interface rather than concrete classes)
